    title: Principal Investigator
    excerpt: "I am a social- and cognitive neuroscientist from Germany but spent most of my scientific career in Belgium. I am Einstein Professor for ‘Social Intelligence’ at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain and the Department of Psychology at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Furthermore, I am PI in the excellence cluster ‘Science of Intelligence’. After my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich, I worked six years at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig where I was also awarded a Heisenberg fellowship from the German Research Foundation (DFG). In 2006, I received a research professorship at Ghent University where I worked until I was awarded an Einstein Strategic Professorship in 2020. I am interested in the neuro-cognitive mechanisms underlying our social behaviour and group influence. Furthermore, I want to understand how people intentionally control their thoughts and actions. Finally, I am investigating the influence of high-level beliefs on basic cognitive processes."

I am currently a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Humboldt University of Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Marcel Brass. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto with a double major in Cognitive Science and Philosophy. My PhD training is in the emerging field of Social Cognitive Neuroscience and was completed at McMaster University under the supervision of Prof. Sukhvinder Obhi. My Post-Doctoral research focuses on the Sense of Agency; although my research interests span a number of topics including: empathy, social power, and various human mirror neuron system indices (e.g., automatic imitation, motor resonance)."

    title: Postdoctoral Research Fellow
    excerpt: "My name is Matilde Rocca, and I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Social Intelligence Lab. I did my PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Turin, within the Cognition, Motion and Neuroscience Lab led by Prof. Cristina Becchio, under the supervision of Prof. Andrea Cavallo. I performed all my research activity at the Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, based in Genoa, Italy. My PhD project focused on studying how we represent other people's actions when we actively engage in a social interaction with them. To do this, I studied detailed aspects of upper-limb movement kinematics during real-time dyadic joint actions. Within the Social Intelligence Lab, I aim to investigate how we represent the actions performed by multiple agents simultaneously, and how these representations affect our own motor behaviour, in order to address issues related to social group conformity from a motor perspective."

    excerpt: "My name is Asieh Daneshi and I come from Iran. I am currently a Post-Doc researcher in Marcel’s lab. My bachelor and master studies were on electrical engineering and my PhD was on biomedical engineering (bioelectric). For my PhD, I worked on computational models of decision-making during driving (based on attention). I conducted my experiments in virtual reality environment. I have also experience in recording and analyzing eye motion, EEG, and fMRI data. I am interested to study how does the decision-making process take place in our brains, especially in dynamic environments. The title of my current project in Marcel’s lab is “Experimental investigation of behavioral contagion in VR”. We are studying how decisions of each person can affect the decisions of other persons around him/her."

    title: Postdoctoral Research Fellow
    excerpt: "I’m an FWO postdoctoral fellow and I come from Belgium, where I studied philosophy (‘14) and psychology (‘16) in Antwerp and Ghent. For my PhD (’16-‘20), supervised by Prof. Gilles Pourtois, I investigated how people switch attention between external (sensory) and internal (mental) input. I worked with Prof. Tobias Egner at Duke University (’21-’22) on the balance between external and internal attention in general, drawing inspiration from literatures on visual search, working memory, mind wandering, sustained attention, mental effort, and meditation. Here in Berlin, together with Prof. Marcel Brass and Dr. Michael Gaebler, I will investigate interoceptive attention (access to the internal body) and how it relates to exteroceptive attention, especially when learning to control visceromotor responses (“interoaction”). In addition, I’m interested in comparing 1st and 3rd person perspectives on cognition. Novel methods have been developed recently to directly access what’s in someone’s mind’s eye from a 3rd person perspective, but contemplative traditions, such as meditation and yoga, draw their insights purely from a 1st person perspective. My aim is to see how both approaches can complement each other."

    title: PhD Student
    excerpt: "My name is Mathias Van der Biest, and I am a PhD student from Belgium. During my master thesis (Ghent University), I investigated how making a choice affects our preference for arbitrary tasks (promotor: Prof. Dr. Marcel Brass and Dr. David Wisniewski). Moreover, I joined the Sampendu lab (University of Auckland, Prof. Dr. Sam Schwarzkopf) for a six-month research internship, where I investigated the interplay between cognition and visual perception in virtual reality environments. Following my masters, I started with a PhD in the lab of Prof. Marcel Brass and in 2021 I was awarded the FWO aspirant fundamental research grant. In my PhD project, I investigate how key social attributes (e.g. trustworthiness, social status) of the instructor modulate how we process novel instructions (e.g. sensory processing, encoding, preparation, implementation)."

I attempt to recreate aspects of the social world in VR environments as I am intrigued by the confluence between cognitive neuroscience and anthropology. I completed my postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford and previously received training in cognitive science from Indian Institute of Technology (IITGN) at the Control and Learning of Action Lab. I have a keen interest in embodied cognition, two-person neuroscience and group conformity."

I am currently a Ph.D student at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Marcel Brass and Prof. Dr. Michael Pauen. My research topic is about manipulating laypeople’s subjective belief in free will through immersive Virtual Reality experiences. I investigate whether adding an experience to the method of manipulation could have an impact on down-stream processes (e.g. behavior, cognitive process), which was not the case for previous methods in literature. Further, my research interests include various topics such as: social facilitation, Theory of Mind, and cultural differences in beliefs."
